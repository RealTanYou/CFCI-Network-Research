This project and program was created for the Centre for Cyberseucurity Insitutute, Vocational Training Programme, Network Research Module.

This aim for the project was to demonstrate the automation of:

1. Checks and Installation of various required programs, such as nmap and nipe, and the setup of them.
2. The scanning, logging into the remote server, and remote probing of various servers and URLs.
3. Automation of downloading of results.

This project deliberately downloads the results using an insecure protocol, FTP, to also demonstrate via wireshark how easily data can be extracted from a simple packet tracing program.
